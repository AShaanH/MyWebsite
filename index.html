      <h2>About Me</h2>   
<div></div><h3>Hi My name is Shaan Hussain. I am currently in the All Star Code Brotherhood and it has been an amazing journey and I have learnt alot. Some of my hobbies would be doing some coding on the side and watching anime. One other thing about me is that I am a Muslim.</h3></div>
        <h2>Education</h2><div></div><h3>I am currently enrolled in Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Education. I am in the Electrical engineering program, which I dont like, but at least I got into All Star Code which made my interest CS stronger and makes me want to delve deeper into the world of programming. For college I want to go to either Syracuse or NYIT. I think these schools will help increase my knowledge in CS and prepare me for professional programming jobs. </h3></div>
